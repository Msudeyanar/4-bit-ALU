**Project Overview

This project involves the design of a 4-bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU is a digital circuit capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations. This project has been created to simulate and develop the basic functions of the ALU.
As a result, the project is being revisited for FPGA application using the Tang Primer 20k FPGA. The circuit includes a 7-segment display and a 4511 TTL chip for BCD to 7-segment display encoding.

**Features

4-bit inputs: Works with 4-bit data inputs.
Supported operations:
Addition
Subtraction
AND
OR
XOR

Displaying results: Outputs are shown on the 7-segment display as 4-bit results.
FPGA Application: Revisited on the Tang Primer 20k FPGA.
BCD to 7SD Encoding: BCD to 7-segment display encoding is done using the 4511 TTL chip.
